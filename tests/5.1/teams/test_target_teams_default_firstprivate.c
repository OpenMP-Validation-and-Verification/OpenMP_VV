//===--------- test_target_teams_default_firstprivate.c ----------------------===//
//
// OpenMP API Version 5.1 Nov 2020
//
// This test uses the default(firstprivate) clause on a teams directive. The test
// validates that when the default(firstprivate) clause is present that all
// variables without explicit sharing rules is not avaialble outside the region
// and is encapsulated between each thread. Starting with the initial value from
// outside the region. This is checked by by establishing a not_shared value. Since
// all changes should not persist after the construct region, it should have 
// not changed. Additionally if there is a race condition, we know the variable 
// is not defaulting to firstprivate either.
