//--------------- test_metadirective_otherwise.c ----------------------------//
// OpenMP API Version 5.2 Nov 2021
// *************************
// DIRECTIVE: metadirective
// CLAUSES: when, otherwise
// *************************
// The otherwise clause of the metadirective construct is being tested. The
// metadirective construct contains a when clause, which itself contains a
// context-selector (device = {kind(nohost)}) and a directive-variant (nothing).
// The metadirective construct also contains an otherwise clause, which itself
// contains a directive-variant (target map(tofrom : on_host)).
// The when clause of the metadirective construct is
// evaluated for a valid context-selector pertaining to a device related
// characteristic of a certain kind (nohost), defined in the OpenMP additional
// definitions. If a target construct were specified, the evaluation would
// be true, and the directive-variant nothing would be executed as if
// #pragma omp nothing were present. Target is not present, so the
// directive-variant of the otherwise clause will be executed. This would not
// occur if device = {kind(host)} were specified. If omp_is_initial_device()
// evaluates to false (0), then the test will pass.
