// This test ensures that--paraphrase of Section 5.8.6--a pointer that is
// implicitly mapped or explicitely mapped to the device, predetermined to be
// firstprivate in the device data environment, will retain its original value
// (attained prior to the target region) and follow the semantics of the
// firstprivate clause. This is true if a matching mapped list item, as defined
// in Section 5.8.6, is not found for the pointer. In the test, the pointer p1
// is initialized with the base array address of arr2. When p1 is implicitly
// mapped to the device, it should retain the same base array address, as the
// array itself is not mapped (a matching mapped list item is not found). This
// check is made in the target region with a mapped integer variable holding the
// base address of arr2. The pointer p2 is initialized to NULL, and is checked
// to remain NULL after being initialized on a device. Following the checks, p1
// is changed to NULL on the device and checked outside of the target region if
// it was not changed from its initial value of the base address of arr2 (per
// firstprivate semnatics). p2 is given an arbitrary value for the purpose of
// ensuring that it too retains its original value after the target region. A
// defaultmap clause is present on the target construct to explicitely ensure
// that the default semantics of mapping apply to all mapped (implicit/explicit)
// pointer types.
