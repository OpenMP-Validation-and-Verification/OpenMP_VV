!===--- test_target_teams_distribute_num_teams.F90--------------------------===//
!
! OpenMP API Version 4.5 Nov 2015
!
! This test uses the num_teams clause on a target teams distribute directive to
! indicate a requested number of teams to execute the teams distribute region.
! The specifications indicate that the number of teams that are given can be any
! number that is equal to or less than the indicated value.  We first run a
! target teams distribute region without the clause to see what the default
! number of teams is, and then we use a value that is less than that in the
! test of the num_teams clause.  If the region is run with more teams than
! indicated, the test errors.  If the region is run with less teams than
! indicated, the test issues a warning since it is known that the device can
! run with more teams than was actually given.
