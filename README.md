Welcome to the new OpenMP Validation and Verification project.
This was initially SOLLVE_VV, sub-project of the ECP SOLLVE project which concluded in 2023. 
Currently this effort is funded by the Sustainability For node level Programming Systems and Tools (S4PST) Project.

This is an active collaboration between Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the Computational Research and Programming Lab (led by Prof. Sunita Chandrasekaran) at University of Delaware.
